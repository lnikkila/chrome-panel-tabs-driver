Code dumping ground for the ill-fated Panel Tabs v2 driver (ca. 2015) that
attempted to implement panels through the `chrome.app.windows` API.

Expect no updates to this repo nor any sort of usage instructions, since it’s
incredibly hacky and incomplete. If you truly have a use for some of this code,
let me know and I’ll put up more details.
